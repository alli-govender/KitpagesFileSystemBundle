KitpagesFileSystemBundle
========================

This is a bundle that provides a filesystem abstraction layer. Basicaly this does the
same as the gaufrette library from KnpLabs, but it manages much more efficiently big files. We can
manage a 2GB file with a memory limit of 128Mo for the PHP process. We never transfert the entire
content in a $content variable.

With this bundle you can save your files on different filesystems (S3, Local filesystem, FTP,...)

Some elements of the configuration system are based on the code of the KnpGaufretteBundle.
